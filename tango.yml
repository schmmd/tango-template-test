  # These are the Beaker clusters that you want to use to run steps.
  # Tango will inspect all of the clusters in this list at runtime and pick
  # the first one with enough free resources for your jobs.

    - ai2/general-cirrascale

# This tells Tango where to look for your custom step classes.
# Each item in the list can be a path to a directory or Python file, or a Python
# module name (e.g. 'my_package.steps').

  - steps.py

# Adjust the log level as you want. "info" is probably a good place to start.
